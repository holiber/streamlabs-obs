      link: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnRhaZaQ2ns',
      image: 'frame-management.png',
      infoOverview:
        'It’s important to understand that frame issues are often caused by CPU and GPU overload, and you can identify when there’s a problem by keeping an eye on them in your Windows task manager. Also note that certain games and applications can be more taxing on the CPU or GPU, and this will vary from different programs. There are three main types of lost frames: Lagged frames, which are caused by a compositor overload, and common with high GPU usage; Skipped frames, which occur when the encoder is overloaded, often with high CPU usage; and dropped frames, which happen when network issues exist and could be caused by servers or equipment.',
      infoDirections:
        'For issues with lagged frames, we recommend to try lowering the quality of the game so Streamlabs OBS has some breathing room to compose the frames of the encoder. You can also limit the FPS or use V-sync. We recommend you consider locking your settings in your game to 120FPS and 120Hz, as this nicely divides for 60FPS and 30FPS streaming. When experiencing skipped frames, check for high CPU usage. If you’re using software x264 encoding, consider using a faster preset or start using hardware encoding (NVENC/AMD) and this will be less taxing on your CPU to encode the stream. Poor network or internet connections are often the cause of dropped frames. Try manually connecting to the closest server on the streaming platform you’re using. You can also try to restart your networking gear, like your modem, router, or switches, and see if that helps. Lastly, you’ll want to also check that the video and audio bitrate is not exceeding your internet upload speed, so be sure to check both of these. There are many internet speed tests websites you can use to check your speed for free.',

      infoOverview:
        'Sometimes alert issues come up. We have some tips on how to effectively identify and correct issues you may have with your alerts using Streamlabs OBS.',
      infoDirections:
        'First we recommend trying the basics: making sure your software is up to date. Check your version of Streamlabs OBS to make sure it’s the current version. You can see what version your software is in the upper left side of the application. If you’re not sure, you can always get a fresh download to install from streamlabs.com, where we always have the latest version to download. Most Streamlabs tools use Twitch, YouTube, Mixer or other APIs to pull info. Logging out of Streamlabs and then logging back in, with the streaming service account that was causing issues, will attempt to recreate the connection. In Streamlabs OBS, make sure you fully log out of the application by clicking the logout button on the upper-right. Restart the application and log back in to reactivate your widgets. Sometimes an Alert issue may originate from the connection between your Streamlabs OBS and the website, or the cache within the source. If you are using Streamlabs OBS, try to clear the cache by removing your Widget Sources and re-adding them back in. Please watch our YouTube video for more suggestions.',
